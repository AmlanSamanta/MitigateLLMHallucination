# MitigateLLMHallucination

LLM Hallucinations are natural and a topic of active research. In this repo, I would be exploring different toolings and capabilities that can be employed to reduce the effect of hallucinations.


The first notebook 'Hallucination_Mitigation_LLM_SingleStore.ipynb' is trying to evaluate the capabilities of the solutions provided by SingleStore which offers out-of-the-box techniques for different search technologies through its SaaS platform. These capabilities can be deployed in a RAG pipeline based app for better search experience and reducing hallucinations in turn.
